# Task-Management-System
The Task Management System is a Spring Boot backend application with MySQL, Spring Security, and JWT for authentication. Users can register, log in, and manage tasks through CRUD operations. Each user can only access their own tasks, ensuring secure data management, while admins have full control over all tasks.
